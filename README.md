This project is a banking application built using Go + PostgreSQL + Docker. I have used Go as the backend language, PostgreSQL as the database, SQLC for generating type-safe SQL queries, and `go-playground/validator` for input validation. The project also includes comprehensive unit tests written with `testify` and `GoMock` for mocking dependencies. The project also includes CI tests written using GitHub workflows and code coverage is also tracked and uploaded to Codecov ([find it here](https://app.codecov.io/gh/1shubham7/banking-application)). Build automation and commands are managed using Makefile.

‚≠ê Star us on GitHub ‚Äî it motivates me a lot!
